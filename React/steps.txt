To start a React app, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

Step 1: Set up the development environment:

- Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).

Step 2: Create a new React project:

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to create your React project.
- Run the following command to create a new React app using Create React App (a popular tool for bootstrapping React projects):
```
npx create-react-app my-app
```
Note: Replace `my-app` with the desired name of your app.

Step 3: Navigate to the project directory:
- Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory using the following command:
```
cd my-app
```
Note: Replace `my-app` with the name of your app.

Step 4: Start the development server:
- To start the development server and run your React app, use the following command:
```
npm start
```
This command will compile your app and open it in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Step 5: Explore and modify the app:
- Open your code editor and navigate to the project directory.
- You'll find the project structure and files created by Create React App. The main file you'll work with is `src/App.js`, which contains the main component of your app.

Step 6: Make changes and see them in the browser:
- Open `src/App.js` in your code editor and modify the contents of the component as desired. You can also create additional components in separate files and import them into `App.js`.
- Save your changes, and the development server will automatically update the browser to reflect the modifications.

That's it! You've successfully started a React app.
