Each step of the project planning and requirements gathering process in a detailed manner, explaining it in the context of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

1. Project Overview:
   - In this phase, you define the purpose and objectives of the project, setting the foundation for the development process.
   - This aligns with the SDLC's "Initiation" phase, where you identify the need for the project and define its objectives.

2. Requirements Gathering:
   - This phase involves collecting and documenting the project's requirements, both functional and non-functional, to ensure a clear understanding of what needs to be developed.
   - Similar to the SDLC's "Requirements Gathering" phase, it focuses on understanding user needs, conducting stakeholder interviews, and documenting requirements.

3. Scope Definition:
   - Scope definition involves clearly defining the boundaries and extent of the project to avoid scope creep or ambiguity.
   - It aligns with the SDLC's "Requirements Analysis" phase, where you define the scope and boundaries of the system to be developed.

4. Project Plan Creation:
   - In this phase, you break down the project into smaller tasks and activities, estimate time and resources, create a schedule, and assign responsibilities to team members.
   - This corresponds to the SDLC's "Design" and "Planning" phases, where you plan the architecture, identify tasks, estimate resources, and create a project schedule.

5. Review and Validation:
   - This phase involves reviewing the project plan and requirements with stakeholders to ensure their alignment and obtain feedback.
   - It aligns with the SDLC's "Validation" phase, where you review the project plan and requirements, validate them with stakeholders, and make necessary revisions.

6. Documentation:
   - Documenting the finalized project plan, requirements, and scope is essential for reference and clarity throughout the development process.
   - This aligns with the SDLC's "Documentation" phase, where you create necessary documentation, diagrams, and charts to aid in development and future reference.

By following these steps and incorporating them into the SDLC, you ensure a systematic and structured approach to project planning and requirements gathering, resulting in a well-defined foundation for the development of your e-commerce app.



Sure! Here's a project plan for an e-commerce app from a frontend developer's perspective, incorporating the SDLC method:

1. Project Overview:
   - Define the purpose: Develop a responsive and user-friendly e-commerce app to facilitate online shopping.
   - Objectives: Create an intuitive user interface, optimize performance, and ensure seamless navigation.

2. Requirements Gathering:
   - Conduct stakeholder interviews with business owners and product managers to understand their vision and gather requirements.
   - Identify functional requirements, such as product listing, search functionality, shopping cart, payment integration, and user authentication.
   - Determine non-functional requirements, including responsiveness, cross-browser compatibility, and performance optimization.

3. Scope Definition:
   - Define the boundaries: The frontend development scope includes designing and implementing the user interface and connecting it with backend APIs.
   - Exclusions: Backend development, database design, and server infrastructure fall outside the scope.

4. Project Plan Creation:
   - Breakdown of tasks:
     - Design phase: Create wireframes, prototypes, and UI mockups (2 weeks).
     - Development phase: Implement frontend components, integrate APIs, and perform testing (6 weeks).
     - User Interface (UI) polishing: Fine-tune UI elements, optimize responsiveness, and ensure cross-browser compatibility (1 week).
     - Integration testing: Validate the app's functionality and usability (1 week).
     - Bug fixing and refinements: Address user feedback and make necessary enhancements (1 week).
   - Task dependencies: Design phase precedes the development phase, and integration testing follows the development phase.
   - Resource estimation: Allocate two frontend developers, one UI/UX designer, and a testing specialist.
   - Project timeline: Total estimated time for completion is 11 weeks.

5. Review and Validation:
   - Conduct regular meetings with stakeholders to review the project plan, wireframes, and UI mockups.
   - Validate the requirements against the stakeholder's expectations and incorporate feedback.
   - Perform code reviews and testing to ensure adherence to quality standards.

6. Documentation:
   - Document the finalized project plan, including timelines, task breakdowns, and resource allocation.
   - Create documentation for UI design guidelines, API integration, and testing procedures.
   - Maintain a version control repository to track changes and updates.

By following this project plan, you can ensure a structured and organized approach to frontend development for the e-commerce app, aligning with the SDLC methodology and facilitating a smooth development process.
