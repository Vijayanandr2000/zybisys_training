Asynchronous JavaScript:
JavaScript is primarily a single-threaded programming language, which means it can only execute one task at a time. However, when dealing with tasks like fetching data from a server, making API requests, or performing time-consuming operations, it's important to avoid blocking the main thread and keep the application responsive. Asynchronous programming allows us to achieve this by executing tasks concurrently without blocking the execution flow.

Promises:
Promises are a built-in feature in JavaScript that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous code. A Promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

Here's an example that demonstrates the basic usage of Promises:

```javascript
const fetchData = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = 'This is some data.';
      resolve(data);
    }, 2000);
  });
};

fetchData()
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In this example, `fetchData` is a function that returns a Promise. Inside the Promise's executor function, we use `setTimeout` to simulate an asynchronous operation. After the timeout, the Promise is resolved with the data.

The `fetchData` function is then called, and we use `.then()` to handle the resolved value and `.catch()` to handle any errors that may occur during the asynchronous operation.

Async/Await:
Async/Await is a more recent addition to JavaScript that provides a syntactic sugar on top of Promises, making asynchronous code easier to read and write. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks similar to synchronous code, improving code readability and maintainability.

Let's see an example of how Async/Await can be used:

```javascript
const fetchData = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = 'This is some data.';
      resolve(data);
    }, 2000);
  });
};

const fetchDataAsync = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

fetchDataAsync();
```

In this example, we define an `async` function `fetchDataAsync`. Inside this function, we use the `await` keyword to pause the execution until the Promise returned by `fetchData()` is resolved. The resolved value is then assigned to the `data` variable, and we can continue with the synchronous-style code.

The `try-catch` block allows us to handle any errors that occur during the asynchronous operation.
