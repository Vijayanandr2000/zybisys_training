Day 4 â†’ JavaScript DOM Manipulation and Events:

The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree-like structure, where each element in the HTML document is represented as a node in the DOM tree. JavaScript allows you to interact with the DOM to modify the content, structure, and styling of webpages dynamically. Additionally, JavaScript provides event handling mechanisms to respond to user interactions and trigger actions based on those events.

Here are the key concepts and techniques related to JavaScript DOM manipulation and events:

1. Accessing DOM Elements:
   - Use methods like `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, or `getElementsByTagName` to retrieve specific elements from the DOM.
   - Assign elements to variables for further manipulation.

2. Modifying DOM Elements:
   - Update the content of an element using the `textContent` or `innerHTML` properties.
   - Modify attributes of elements using properties like `src`, `href`, `className`, etc.
   - Change the styling of elements by modifying their CSS properties using the `style` property.

3. Creating and Inserting DOM Elements:
   - Use the `createElement` method to create new DOM elements.
   - Manipulate the newly created element's properties and content.
   - Insert elements into the DOM using methods like `appendChild`, `insertBefore`, or `replaceChild`.

4. Event Handling:
   - Register event listeners on elements using methods like `addEventListener`.
   - Specify the event type (e.g., 'click', 'submit', 'mouseover') and the function to be executed when the event occurs.
   - Access event-related information through the event object (e.g., target element, event type).

5. Responding to Events:
   - Perform actions when events are triggered, such as validating form input, updating content, or invoking functions.
   - Use conditional statements and loops to implement dynamic behavior based on user interactions.
